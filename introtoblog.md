# Welcome to my blog
### This blog is for anyone who sees a future of humans communicating just by thinking and not using voice.

## Why i created the blog ?
* i have always been extemely fascinated by the human brain, there is too much to feel and so less time to say,i thought a lot and somehow the only conclusion of my aim to make humans much better that is removing all the social , monetary , behaviourial evils prevailing around the humans  was to create something that lets humans connect, feel and share the understandings of the human brain. So to share this journey i created this blog, to record  introspect and connect with other human beings.
